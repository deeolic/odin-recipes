    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This strawberry blender cake uses a cheater methodâ€”making the batter in a blender. You'll then go on to make an
        extraordinary strawberry dessert, similar to strawberry shortcake, but with a cake layer that already tastes
        like strawberry and has the perfect texture to soak up all the delicious juices.</p>

    <h2>How to Make the Strawberry Blender Cake</h2>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil a 9x5-inch loaf pan, and line with parchment, leaving
            overhang on the 2 long sides.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For the cake, add sliced strawberries, eggs, vegetable oil, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla to
            the jar of a blender, and blend on High until mixture is emulsified, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add flour and blend on High until the flour is thoroughly incorporated, about 30 seconds more. Use a spatula
            to scrape down the sides of the blender; blend a bit more if necessary to incorporate all flour. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer batter into the prepared pan. Tap the pan on a towel to settle the batter. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted near the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let
            cool completely, then remove from the pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For strawberries, add sliced berries to a bowl and cover with sugar. Mix briefly, cover, and let sit for 30
            minutes. Stir thoroughly with a spoon, and let sit another 30 minutes. Repeat this process twice more, or
            until the berries have produced as much juice as you like. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For whipped topping, add mascarpone, sugar, and vanilla to a mixing bowl, and beat with an electric mixer
            for 20 seconds to loosen and soften the cheese. Add in the cream, and continue to beat until medium-stiff
            peaks form.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To assemble, slice cake into 1-inch slices (about 8). Place a slice in a shallow serving bowl, and spoon
            berry juices over cake until saturated. Add a spoonful of berries, then a generous dollop of whipped cream,
            and more berries and juice as desired.</li>
        <br>
    </ol>
